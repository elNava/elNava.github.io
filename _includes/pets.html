                        This cat recieves his name because he meows extremely loud,
                        and when he does, it sounds more like "mao" than "meow".

                        Peluche is the spanish for teddy. This cat is so beautiful,
                        soft and cuddly that we decided to give her that name.

                        We adopted this poor cat in our house. She missed an eye,
                        like a pirate, that's why she is called "Pirata". We love her so much.

                        Lucky arrived a few years after Cacique. He was a funny poodle, quite happy and
                        always excited to play with humans. The word exhausted did not exists in his
                        vocabulary.

                        Cacique is the name that the Spanish conquerors gave to the local leaders of
                        indigenous communities. This is the first dog I have memory of adopting.
