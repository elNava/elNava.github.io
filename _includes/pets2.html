                        Lucky arrived a few years after Cacique. He was a funny poodle, quite happy and
                        always excited to play with humans. The word exhausted did not exists in his
                        vocabulary.

                        Cacique is the name that the Spanish conquerors gave to the local leaders of
                        indigenous communities. This is the first dog I have memory of adopting.
