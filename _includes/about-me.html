            <h2>About me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I am a master's student in Astronomy at the Department of Astronomy (DAS) of Universidad de Chile. I do
                research in galaxy evolution, but I am particularly interested in the physics of galaxies at the first
                billion years from the Big-Bang. You can check the <a href="#research">Research</a> page for further
                information about my projects. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also part of the <a href="https://sochias.cl/tiempo-de-observacion/lista-blanca/">
                SOCHIAS Whitelist</a> for availability to apply to observing time to the Chilean Telescope Allocation Committee
                <a href="https://das.uchile.cl/cntac/">CNTAC</a> and the possibility to use telescopes at ESO, Las Campanas and 
                Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Besides, as Valentino Gonzalez is my advisor, I am part of the
                <a href="https://cata.cl">CATA</a> affiliates, the Center for Astrophysics and Associated Tecnologies.
            </p>

                I am also a huge enthusiastic outside academy. I like teaching, and I have been involved in several public
                outreach activities. We have a tremendous amount of knowledge waiting to be shared with people.

            <p>
                I love to do a lot of things, from sharing with friends, to some sports, and even board games like chess.
                But what I like above almost everything is to spend time with my three little cats. I used to have dogs also,
                and althought they are not with me anymore, they were a fundamental part of my life. Therefore, I decided to
                include a space for these cuties here below.
