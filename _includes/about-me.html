            <h2>About me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I am a master's student in Astronomy at the Department of Astronomy (DAS) of Universidad de Chile. I do
                research in galaxy evolution, but I am particularly interested in the physics of galaxies in the first
                billion-years from the Big-Bang.

                I am also a huge enthusiastic outside academy. I like teaching, and I have been involved in several public
                outreach activities. We have a tremendous amount of knowledge waiting to be shared with people.

                I love to do a lot of things, from sharing with friends, to some sports, and even board games like chess.
                But what I like above almost everything is to spend time with my three little cats. I used to have dogs also,
                and althought they are not with me anymore, they were a fundamental part of my life. Therefore, I decided to
                include a space for these cuties here below.
