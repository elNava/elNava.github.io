                                We went to an extremely remote rural village called San Pedro in the Santiago Metropoilitan
                                Region to make the <i>Make your own comet!</i> workshop to kids from those schools. The people
                                was from very low class and have very poor conditions, so we were delighted to share some

                                and the Andromeda galaxy collide. I gave this talk at the CEC school, which is the school
                                where I did my primary and secondary studies. I got very emotional by this, because I
                                brought astronomy to a very poor school, with students from vulnerable zones.

                                along with their teachers during 2022. It was inspiring to see such young ethusiast caring about
